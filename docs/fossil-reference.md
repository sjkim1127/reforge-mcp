# fossil-mcp

> MCP server that helps locate where a feature is implemented inside an open-source repository.

fossil-mcp clones a public repository, indexes code symbols, stores the index locally, and exposes MCP tools that an assistant can call when it needs exact files, line ranges, signatures, and nearby call relationships.

It is intentionally modest in scope: it does not claim to understand every behavior in a project, and it does not replace reading the source. Its job is to reduce the time between a natural-language feature question and the implementation candidates worth inspecting.

## What this is

- fossil-mcp is a local MCP server for implementation search.
- It is built for assistants that need source-grounded answers instead of broad repository summaries.
- The server uses stdio transport through the `rmcp` crate.
- The primary workflow is clone, index, locate, then read source.
- Repositories are cloned into a local cache under the user cache directory.
- Code symbols are stored in a local SQLite database so repeated searches do not require re-parsing the repository.
- Search results include symbol names, kinds, language identifiers, file paths, line ranges, signatures, scores, and one-hop related symbols when available.
- The current implementation supports Rust, Python, TypeScript, and JavaScript-family extensions through tree-sitter parsing, with SCIP support when an `index.scip` file is available.
- For Rust repositories, indexing may try to create a SCIP index by invoking `rust-analyzer scip .` when a Cargo manifest exists and no `index.scip` is present.
- When SCIP is unavailable, fossil-mcp falls back to tree-sitter based symbol and call extraction.

## Current capabilities

- Clone public Git repositories with shallow depth.
- Reuse cached clones by stable repository id.
- Refresh a cached repository on demand.
- Assign an optional alias to a cloned repository.
- Checkout a requested branch or tag during clone.
- Index functions, methods, structs, classes, traits, interfaces, enums, and modules where parser support exists.
- Build a simple one-hop call graph from parser-visible call expressions.
- Store repository metadata, symbols, call edges, and embeddings in SQLite.
- Search by natural language or keywords.
- Prefer semantic vector search when embeddings are generated and searchable.
- Fall back to fuzzy symbol search when semantic search does not return results.
- Return source snippets by repository id, relative file path, and inclusive line range.
- List cached and indexed repositories.
- Run a one-shot clone, index, and locate flow through `analyze_feature`.
- Analyze structural migration patterns between two git revisions.
- Scan local workspaces for structural vulnerability patterns.
- Index local Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C/C++ dependency sources where package manager caches are available.
- Update or remove a single file from the index without re-indexing the whole workspace.
- Watch a local workspace and update changed files after a short debounce.
- Evict old cached repositories when the cache exceeds the configured internal capacity limit.
- Persist goals and ordered roadmap milestones in the local SQLite database.
- Track milestone states (`planned`, `in_progress`, `blocked`, `done`) and calculate roadmap progress.

## Non-goals

- fossil-mcp is not a full program analysis engine.
- fossil-mcp is not a proof system for feature ownership.
- fossil-mcp is not a replacement for language servers, tests, or code review.
- fossil-mcp does not execute target repository code.
- fossil-mcp does not provide vulnerability claims by itself.
- fossil-mcp does not guarantee complete call graph coverage across dynamic dispatch, macros, decorators, generated code, or runtime registration.
- fossil-mcp does not currently index every programming language.
- fossil-mcp does not currently provide a network server transport.
- fossil-mcp should be treated as a locator and triage tool.

## Quick start

- Install a recent Rust toolchain. The workspace uses Rust 2024 edition and declares Rust 1.88 as the minimum supported version.
- Clone this repository.
- Build the release binary.
- Point your MCP client at the compiled `fossil-mcp` executable.
- Use the MCP tools from your assistant session.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sjkim1127/reforge-mcp
cd fossil-mcp
cargo build --release
```

The binary is expected at:

```text
target/release/fossil-mcp
```

## Client configuration

Use an absolute path to the release binary in your MCP client configuration.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fossil-mcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/fossil-mcp/target/release/fossil-mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

For verbose server-side logging during local development:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "fossil-mcp": {
      "command": "/absolute/path/to/fossil-mcp/target/release/fossil-mcp",
      "env": {
        "FOSSIL_LOG": "fossil_server=debug,warn"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## Typical workflows

### Clone, index, locate

1. Call `clone_reference` with a public Git URL.
2. Use the returned `repo_id` with `index_repo`.
3. Call `locate_implementation` with a feature query.
4. Use `get_symbol_source` on the best candidate line range.

### One-shot analysis

1. Call `analyze_feature` with `repo_url` and `query`.
2. Inspect the returned top matches.
3. Fetch source for candidates that look relevant.

### Refresh a repository

1. Call `clone_reference` with `refresh: true`.
2. Run `index_repo` again after the refresh.
3. Search again with the same query to compare results.

### Narrow by language

1. Call `index_repo` with a `languages` list such as `["rust"]`.
2. Use this when a repository includes generated code or frontend code that is not relevant.
3. Remember that filtering happens after symbol extraction.

### Cross-repository lookup

1. Index multiple repositories.
2. Call `locate_implementation` without `repo_id`.
3. Compare the returned `repo_id` and file paths for each match.

### `clone_reference`

- `repo_url` is required.
- `alias` is optional and human-friendly.
- `branch` is optional and passed to the clone builder.
- `refresh` deletes the existing clone before cloning again when true.
- The repository id is derived from the repository URL with a short SHA-256 prefix.
- The clone is shallow with depth 1.
- git2 is tried first, and the git CLI is used as a fallback if git2 clone fails.

### `index_repo`

- `repo_id` is required.
- `languages` is optional; an empty list means all supported languages.
- The indexer checks for `index.scip` and prefers SCIP when present.
- Rust repositories may trigger `rust-analyzer scip .` when no SCIP file exists.
- Tree-sitter indexing is used as the fallback.
- Symbols are persisted to SQLite.
- Embeddings are generated in chunks to reduce memory spikes.
- Call edges are stored after parsing.

### `locate_implementation`

- `query` is required.
- `repo_id` is optional; omit it to search all indexed repositories.
- `top_k` defaults to 5.
- Semantic search is attempted first.
- Fuzzy search is used when semantic search returns no candidates.
- Results include related symbols from one-hop call edges.
- Scores are useful for ranking but should not be treated as certainty.

### `get_symbol_source`

- `repo_id` is required.
- `file_path` is relative to the cloned repository root.
- `line_start` is 1-indexed.
- `line_end` is inclusive.
- The response includes source text and a language label inferred from file extension.
- Use this after `locate_implementation` rather than guessing paths.

### `list_indexed_repos`

- No meaningful input fields are required.
- The response includes repository id, alias, URL, path, indexed timestamp, and symbol count.
- This is useful when continuing an older assistant session.

### `analyze_feature`

- `repo_url` is required.
- `query` is required.
- The tool clones the repository.
- The tool indexes the repository if it was not already indexed.
- The tool calls `locate_implementation` with a broader top-k.
- This is convenient for first-pass exploration.

### `analyze_migration`

- `repo_id` is required.
- `start_revision` and `end_revision` are git revisions that must exist in the cached clone.
- `file_pattern` selects files to compare.
- The tool extracts structural before/after patterns from changed files.
- Use this for migration research, not as a complete changelog generator.

### `scan_vulnerabilities`

- `workspace_path` is required and must be an absolute path to a local directory.
- The scanner walks parser-supported source files under that directory.
- Built-in patterns currently cover Python SQL string composition, Python `shell=True`, and JavaScript/TypeScript dynamic evaluation.
- The output is structural matches that still require human validation.
- Use this as a triage aid rather than a vulnerability verdict.

### Dependency indexers

- `index_rust_deps` requires a workspace with `Cargo.lock` and local Cargo registry sources.
- `index_python_deps` reads `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml` and local site-packages.
- `index_js_deps` reads `package.json` and local `node_modules`; `include_dev` controls devDependencies.
- `index_cpp_deps` looks for local vcpkg or Conan install layouts.
- Dependency symbols are tagged as external dependency code in storage.
- Already indexed package versions are skipped through the package index cache.

### Incremental indexing

- `update_file_index` requires `workspace_path`, `repo_id`, and `file_path`.
- `remove_file_index` requires `workspace_path`, `repo_id`, and `file_path`.
- `watch_workspace` requires `workspace_path` and `repo_id`.
- `unwatch_workspace` requires `workspace_path`.
- Watchers are in-process; restart them when the MCP server restarts.
- Incremental indexing is for local workspaces where the server can read the file system directly.

## Architecture

- **MCP client**: Sends tool calls over stdio.
- **fossil-server**: Receives MCP calls and orchestrates clone, index, search, and source reads.
- **fossil-repo**: Manages clone operations and cache paths.
- **fossil-indexer**: Parses source files and extracts symbols and call edges.
- **fossil-search**: Ranks symbols by semantic or fuzzy search.
- **fossil-core**: Defines shared types, errors, and SQLite storage.
- **SQLite store**: Persists repositories, symbols, embeddings, and call edges.
- **Cache directory**: Stores shallow clones for repeated use.

```text
MCP client
  | stdio
  v
fossil-server
  | clone/index/search/read
  +--> fossil-repo --> cache directory
  +--> fossil-indexer --> symbols and call edges
  +--> fossil-search --> ranked matches
  +--> fossil-core --> SQLite store
```

## Crate guide

- `crates/fossil-core`: Shared model types, storage, and core errors.
- `crates/fossil-repo`: Repository cloning, repository ids, cache paths, and cache eviction.
- `crates/fossil-indexer`: Language parser registry, tree-sitter parsers, SCIP parsing, symbol extraction, and call graph extraction.
- `crates/fossil-search`: Search traits, fuzzy matching, and semantic search helpers.
- `crates/fossil-server`: MCP server entry point and tool definitions.
- `fixtures`: Small source samples used by tests and parser validation.

## Indexing model

- The index stores symbols rather than arbitrary text chunks.
- A symbol usually corresponds to a function, method, class, struct, trait, interface, enum, or module.
- Line ranges are intended to be directly useful for source retrieval.
- Signatures are kept concise so they can be searched and displayed.
- Call edges are simple name-based relationships extracted from parser-visible call expressions.
- SCIP can improve precision when available.
- Tree-sitter fallback keeps the tool useful without a full language-server setup.

## Search model

- Semantic search is attempted first using generated embeddings.
- Fuzzy search uses symbol names and signatures through the fzf-style matcher.
- A good query can be natural language, a subsystem name, an API name, or a phrase from an error message.
- Search results are candidates, not final conclusions.
- The best workflow is to inspect source for at least the top few matches.
- Related symbols help reveal nearby call paths but do not guarantee complete ownership.

## Storage and cache

- The cache root is managed by the core and repo crates.
- Repository ids are stable for the same URL.
- The global SQLite store tracks metadata and indexed content.
- The server marks repositories as accessed during clone and search operations.
- Cache capacity enforcement evicts older repositories when the cache grows beyond the internal limit.
- Deleting the cache is safe when you are willing to re-clone and re-index repositories.

## Environment variables

- `FOSSIL_LOG` controls tracing filters.
- The default filter is suitable for MCP stdio because logs are written to stderr.
- Use `FOSSIL_LOG=fossil_server=debug,warn` for local debugging.
- `FOSSIL_CACHE_DIR` overrides the default cache root.
- When `FOSSIL_CACHE_DIR` is unset, fossil-mcp uses `~/.fossil-mcp/cache`.
- The SQLite index database is stored as `global.db` inside the cache root.
- Avoid writing logs to stdout because stdout is reserved for the MCP transport.

## Development

- Run `cargo fmt` before committing Rust changes.
- Run `cargo check --workspace` for broad compilation feedback.
- Run focused tests in the crate you changed before broad tests when iteration speed matters.
- Keep parser behavior covered by small fixtures whenever possible.
- Prefer adding a language parser through the `LanguageParser` trait and registry.
- Keep MCP response fields stable unless you intend a client-facing contract change.

## Testing

- Parser tests should validate symbol names, kinds, and line ranges.
- Search tests should distinguish ranking behavior from exact score values when possible.
- Server tests can call tool methods directly.
- Repository clone tests should avoid relying on large or unstable external repositories.
- When adding language support, include representative fixtures for classes, functions, methods, and calls.
- When changing storage, test migration or schema compatibility expectations explicitly.

## Operational notes

- Indexing large repositories may take time.
- Embedding generation can be CPU and memory intensive.
- A shallow clone is usually enough for current implementation search.
- Branch-specific searches should pass the branch during clone.
- Generated code can dominate search results; use language filters or improve ignore logic if needed.
- When results look thin, verify that the repository was indexed successfully.

## Security notes

- fossil-mcp clones public repositories requested by the MCP client.
- Do not point the tool at repositories you are not permitted to copy locally.
- Treat cloned code as untrusted content.
- The current implementation reads and parses source but should not execute target repository code as part of indexing.
- The optional `rust-analyzer scip .` invocation runs a local tool against the cloned repository.
- Review operational policy before using this in a restricted environment.

## Limitations

- Dynamic calls may not appear in the call graph.
- Macro-expanded Rust behavior may not be fully represented by tree-sitter extraction.
- Decorators, metaclasses, dependency injection, and runtime registration can hide implementation ownership.
- Semantic ranking depends on embedding quality and stored vectors.
- Fuzzy ranking depends on symbol names and signatures.
- Line ranges depend on parser node ranges and can include more code than a human would quote.
- SCIP behavior depends on external tooling and project support.
- Only supported language parsers are indexed.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Practical check |
|---|---|
| The MCP client cannot start the server | Use an absolute path to `target/release/fossil-mcp` and confirm the binary exists. |
| The client hangs immediately | Check that logs are not written to stdout; MCP stdio requires stdout for protocol messages. |
| Clone fails with a git2 error | The implementation attempts a git CLI fallback; confirm `git` is installed and the repository URL is public. |
| A repository is cloned but not indexed | Run `index_repo` with the returned `repo_id` and inspect the JSON response. |
| Search returns no symbols | Confirm `symbol_count` is greater than zero and that the language is supported. |
| Search returns irrelevant symbols | Try a more implementation-shaped query with function names, API words, or file concepts. |
| Rust indexing is slow | SCIP generation and embedding generation may take time on larger repositories. |
| Related symbols are sparse | The call graph is one-hop and parser-derived; it is useful context, not a complete graph. |
| Source retrieval fails | Use the exact relative `file_path` and line range returned by `locate_implementation`. |
| Cache grows too large | The server enforces an internal capacity limit, and you can also remove the cache manually when needed. |
