## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Clang include/macro preprocessing with original header source mapping, shared inline-function deduplication, and include-dependency hash invalidation.
- Pinned, unchanged musl `abs.c` fixture with upstream license/provenance and UB boundary checks.
- Independent `reforge-engine` with Clang AST C int32 analysis and deterministic Rust Cargo generation.
- Persistent porting jobs, dependency plans, agent candidate submission, hash invalidation, and append-only events.
- UBSan-backed original/Rust differential verification with bounded processes and retained build/case evidence.
- Real stdio MCP porting/restart smoke probe and compiler-backed regression tests.
- Rust-porting product design for C, C++, Java, Python, and Go with behavioral verification gates.
- `get_porting_capabilities` to distinguish implemented source lookup from planned porting features.
- Semantic search storage through local SQLite vector tables.
- SCIP index support when `index.scip` is present, with tree-sitter fallback.
- One-shot `analyze_feature` workflow for clone, index, and search.
- Structural migration analysis through `analyze_migration`.
- Local workspace vulnerability pattern scanning through `scan_vulnerabilities`.
- Transitive dependency indexing tools for Rust, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, and C/C++ package caches.
- Incremental file indexing and workspace watcher tools for local workspaces.

### Changed
- Product, stdio server identity, executable, and release archives renamed to `reforge-mcp`; update MCP client command paths.
- Previous README preserved in `docs/fossil-reference.md`; internal crate names, cache paths, and `FOSSIL_*` variables retained.
- README now documents the full MCP tool surface and current output contracts.
- CI product baseline now includes warning-free Clippy checks.
- Vulnerability scanning now uses named built-in heuristic patterns instead of mock CVE exact matching.
- Vulnerability scan results now expose `pattern_id` and `severity`, while keeping `cve_id` as a legacy alias.

### Fixed
- Removed dependency-indexer warnings that failed CI with `-D warnings`.
- Ignored macOS Finder metadata files.
- Honored `FOSSIL_CACHE_DIR` and create SQLite parent directories automatically.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **5 MCP tools** via rmcp 2.1 stdio transport:
  - `clone_reference` — shallow-clone a public git repo into `~/.fossil-mcp/cache/`
  - `index_repo` — parse symbols with tree-sitter (Rust, Python, TypeScript) and persist to per-repo SQLite
  - `locate_implementation` — fuzzy-search symbols by name + signature (nucleo-matcher / fzf algorithm)
  - `get_symbol_source` — read raw source for a file/line range
  - `list_indexed_repos` — list cached repos with indexing status
- **1-hop call graph** — `related_symbols` in search results (calls / called_by)
- **3-language support**: Rust (fn, struct, enum, trait, impl), Python (def, class, decorator), TypeScript/JS (function, class, interface, arrow fn)
- **`LanguageParser` trait** — pluggable parser registry for future language additions
- **`Searcher` trait** — pluggable search backend; `FuzzySearcher` is the MVP implementation
- Workspace of 5 crates: `fossil-{core,repo,indexer,search,server}`
- 17 unit tests across all crates
